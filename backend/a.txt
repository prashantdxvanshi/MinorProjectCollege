Zod is used for input validation in which first we have to design schema in zod object and then forward
note--
if module.exports={anything}; then we are exporting it as an object and we have to import like this  import {anything}=require("pathofit");
but if module.exports=anything; then we are exporting it as a function and we have to import it like this import anything=require(pathofit);    
means it is all about our use case if we are using the exporting stuff as function then we have to export them like function
